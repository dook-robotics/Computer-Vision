  I met with Gio and got the Pi camera. I was able to write a few scripts to take a still image
  and to show a live video feed until a kill key ('q') is pressed. Those scripts wont be uploaded
  until I get SSH working on my desktop. I tried for several hours to install TensorFlow onto the
  Pi but was unable to. I think that installing it from scratch will yield better results
  (wipe the pi and start over). I was able to get TF installed on my computer earlier this morning
  and ran a test cnn for the Mnist dataset on it. I am using Anaconda to manage my installs and versions.
  Still very new to Anaconda environments but figuring it out. Tomorrows goal is to put in eight hours
  of work and at minimum complete the project in ref 2. Ideally, I am able to finish the project in ref
  2 and then modify it to recognize cards in general. That would be enough to have a team try and put
  that model on the Pi and start working on movements.
