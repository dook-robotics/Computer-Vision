TensorFlow setup

Notes:
  1) Might bypass step (2) due to information in ref 1.

1) Get TensorFlow to recognize the MNIST dataset on PC. (Individual)
  a) Install Python/TensorFlow
  b) Use TF to solve the MNIST dataset
    i) ref 3

  Notes:
    1) I am using anaconda to manage installs and environment variables
    2) Currently using tensorflow version 1.13.1 which is old (But working)
       I would like to update to the newest tf version if possible.
    3) Successfully ran script from ref 4 (run this to make sure everything is working)

2) Get TensorFlow to recognize the MNIST dataset on the Pi.
  a) Install Python/TensorFlow on the Pi
  b) Use TF to solve the MNIST dataset
    i) ref 3

// ---------- //
Raspberry Pi Camera Setup

3) Get the Pi Camera setup with live video
4) Be able to take pictures with that camera

// ---------- //
Object Detection on the Pi

Notes:
  1) ref 1

5) Detect playing cards on the Pi

// ---------- //
Train custom model

Notes:
  1) ref 2

6) Collect needed images
  a) Set size, use the same camera
7) Label images
8) Train model

// ---------- //
Port model to pi

Notes:
  1) ref 1

9) Get model on Pi
  a) Optimize fpps
