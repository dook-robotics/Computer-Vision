Notes:
  1) ref 2
  2) All of these steps should be able to be done independent of all other areas of the project

1) Start with completing the project in ref 2 (DONE)
2) Modify the training set to classify red and black cards (Or just cards in general)
3) Re do the training with a ARM compatible network make sure it is supported on the pi

  --) Completion of this step (Identifying cards) is enough to try porting to Pi
      to match movements to what the robot is seeing

4) Take pictures of real training/testing cases and then label those
5) Train model on those new images
6) Repeat steps 3 and 4 on harder and harder environments
